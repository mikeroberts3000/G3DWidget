G3DWidget
=========

G3DWidget is a Qt Widget class that can host 3D rendering code from the G3D Innovation Engine. G3DWidget has been carefully designed so that multiple G3DWidget objects can co-exist in the same application. Demo application included.

### Requirements

* __Mac OSX__. I'm using Mountain Lion 10.8.4, but this code should also work for other recent versions of Mac OSX. If you're not on Mac OSX, there is a minimal amount of very easy boilerplate OpenGL code you'll need to implement to get everything working. Drop me a line if you hit any roadblocks.
* __XCode Commandline Tools__. I'm using XCode 4.5.2, but this code should also work for other recent versions of XCode.
  * https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action
* __The G3D 9.00 Source Code__. You'll need to be able to build the G3D 9.00 source code.
  * http://sourceforge.net/projects/g3d/files/g3d-cpp/9.00/G3D-9.00-src.zip/download
* __The Qt SDK__. I'm using Qt 4.8.2 but this code should also work for other recent versions of Qt.
  * http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.2/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.2.dmg
* __Qt Creator__. I'm using Qt Creator 2.8.1 but this code should work for other recent versions of Qt Creator.
  * http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qtcreator/2.8/2.8.1/qt-creator-mac-opensource-2.8.1.dmg

### Build Instructions

1. Replace the files in G3D9-source/GLG3D.lib/... (part of the G3D 9.00 source code) with the files in G3DWidget/Code/GLG3D.lib/... (part of this GitHub repository). There are only 4 files that need to be replaced. This change to the G3D source code is neccesary to add support for multiple rendering windows. I tried to make the changes to the G3D source code is minimally intrusive as possible.
2. Build G3D 9.00 as outlined in G3D documentation.
3. Build G3DWidget/Code/G3DWidgetDemo.pro in Qt Creator. In the Projects > Build and Run > Manage Kits... > Build and Run > Kits menu, set the compiler to Clang (x86 64bit) and set your Qt mkspec to "unsupported/macx-clang". Depending on your exact version of Qt, the exact string you need to use for your Qt mkspec might vary slightly. In the Projects > Build and Run > Build Environment, be sure to add the G3D9DATA environment variable.
4. Now you can run and debug the G3DWidgetDemo application.

### Usage Example

```cpp

//
// When creating G3DWidgets, we need to pass in a G3DWidgetOpenGLContext and a
// GLG3D::RenderDevice. Decoupling the creation of G3DWidgets from OpenGL resources,
// e.g., G3DWidgetOpenGLContext and GLG3D::RenderDevice, allows these resources
// to be shared across multiple G3DWidgets. This is useful, e.g., for rendering
// the same scene from multiple angles in different G3DWidgets.
//
MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget* parent) :
    QMainWindow             (parent),
    m_g3dWidgetOpenGLContext(new G3DWidgetOpenGLContext(G3D::OSWindow::Settings())),
    m_renderDevice          (new G3D::RenderDevice),
    m_starterAppWidget      (new G3DWidget(m_g3dWidgetOpenGLContext, m_renderDevice, this)),
    m_pixelShaderAppWidget  (new G3DWidget(m_g3dWidgetOpenGLContext, m_renderDevice, this)),
    m_timer                 (new QTimer(this)),
    m_g3dWidgetsInitialized (false) {
    
    connect(m_timer, SIGNAL(timeout()), this, SLOT(onTimerTimeout()));
    m_timer->start(15);
}

void MainWindow::paintEvent(QPaintEvent* e) {

    //
    // Note that we need to defer the wiring up of our G3DWidgets until the first
    // paint event because otherwise they are not guaranteed to have valid window handles.
    //
    if (!m_g3dWidgetsInitialized) {

        //
        // Our first step is to initialize the G3DWidgets.
        //
        m_starterAppWidget->initialize();
        m_pixelShaderAppWidget->initialize();

        //
        // Now that we have initialized our G3DWidgets, we can initialize our
        // GLG3D::RenderDevice. Note that we arbitrarily choose a single G3DWidget to
        // initialize our GLG3D::RenderDevice (i.e., instead of passing in m_starterAppWidget,
        // we could have just as easily passed in m_pixelShaderAppWidget). We need to
        // pass in some G3DWidget to prevent the GLG3D::RenderDevice from creating its
        // own. Note also that the G3DWidget we pass in must be current.
        //
        m_starterAppWidget->makeCurrent();
        m_renderDevice->init(m_starterAppWidget);

        //
        // Now that we have have initialized our GLG3D::RenderDevice, we can create our
        // GLG3D::GApps. Note that the G3DWidget we pass in must be current. Note also
        // that the G3D::StarterApp and G3D::PixelShaderApp classes in the code snippet
        // below are identical to those in the starter and pixelShader sample applications
        // in the G3D 9.00 source code. 
        //
        m_starterAppWidget->makeCurrent();
        m_starterApp = new G3D::StarterApp(G3D::GApp::Settings(), m_starterAppWidget, m_renderDevice.get()));

        m_pixelShaderAppWidget->makeCurrent();
        m_pixelShaderApp = new G3D::PixelShaderApp(G3D::GApp::Settings(), m_pixelShaderAppWidget, m_renderDevice.get()));

        //
        // We complete the wiring up of our G3DWidgets by binding a specific GLG3D::GApp
        // to each of them.
        //
        m_starterAppWidget->pushLoopBody(m_starterApp.get());
        m_pixelShaderAppWidget->pushLoopBody(m_pixelShaderApp.get());

        m_g3dWidgetsInitialized = true;
    }
}

void MainWindow::closeEvent(QCloseEvent*) {
    m_starterAppWidget->terminate();
    m_pixelShaderAppWidget->terminate();
    m_renderDevice->cleanup();
}

void MainWindow::onTimerTimeout() {
    m_starterAppWidget->update();
    m_pixelShaderAppWidget->update();
}
```
